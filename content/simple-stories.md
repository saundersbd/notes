title: "Learn to spot and reframe your simple stories"
---

People fall into patterns of telling themselves "simple stories" and automatically filling in the blanks and predicting the endings of those simple stories. Once you spot yourself going down a habitual path of thinking you know how something is going to go, you can reframe the story you tell yourself by:

- Casting another person not as the villain but as the hero in their own story
- Inventing one alternate story, then another, and then another [[Intentionally generate alternate perspectives]]

The point of this exercise is to subvert common thinking patterns and stories you tend to tell yourself.
