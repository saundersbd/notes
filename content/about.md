title: "About These Notes"
---

These are my working notes. Each note represents thoughts-in-progress, inspired by my reading and work.

This is based on the work of several outstanding thinkers and builders who are more capable than I am. Thanks to Andy Matuschak for developing this paradigm with the garage door open, and thanks to Aravind Balla and Aengus McMillin for their work in Gatsby, which made all this possible for me from a technical perspective.

**Here are some things that I've been thinking about lately**:

- The problems with measuring design work against the consistency metric - [[Consistency needs further definition]]
- What does "fit" mean in a design context? - [[Logic means nothing in a design without fit]]
- Defining design requirements - [[Defining requirements by looking at the negatives]]
- The role that assumptions play in the problem-solving process
	- [[Question the assumptions that inform pre-packaged ideas]]
- [[Lateral Thinking]]
- [[Arrive at your own answers]]
