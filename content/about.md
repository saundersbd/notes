title: "About These Notes"
---

These are my working notes. Each note represents thoughts-in-progress, inspired by whatever I might be working on or reading at the time.

This is based on the work of several outstanding thinkers and builders who are more capable than I am. Thanks to Andy Matuschak for the constant inspiration and user experience, and thanks to Aravind Balla and Aengus McMillin for their work in gatsby, which made this site possible for me.

Here are some things that I've been thinking about lately:

- The problems with measuring design work against the consistency metric
	- [[Consistency needs further definition]]
- What does "fit" mean in a design context?
	- [[Logic means nothing in a design without fit]]
- Defining design requirements
	- [[Defining requirements by looking at the negatives]]
- The role that assumptions play in the problem-solving process
	- [[Question the assumptions that come with pre-packaged ideas]]
