title: "A temporary patch will likely become permanent"

Systems generally don't go away. They have a way of lingering and continuing to hold sway over you. When you try to implement a new system, you're doing it amongst the rubble of all the previous failed systems. Your new system doesn't exist in isolation; it adds to and mixes with what was already there.

The old system becomes the new problem. You should be careful about bringing new systems into the world.

I wonder how you avoid the baggage of existing systems when you're trying to introduce something new? The second you formally introduce a new system people will be expecting it to fail, just like the previous systems. Maybe you don't introduce the system—you focus on changing behaviors instead. Get people acting and taking part in the new system without really even realizing they're doing it. If they don't recognize it as a new system they'll be less likely to dismiss it or compare it to what hasn't worked before.

Start with a working, simple system.
