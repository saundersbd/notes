title: "When small systems are expanded into larger systems they don't behave the same"
---

Because complex systems exhibit unexpexted behavior, when you expand a system and make it more complex, you can't predict the results. This makes it hard to scale systems skillfully. If you have an MVP system in place that is working amongst a small group of people, and you want to expand it to include more people, you need to be prepared for weird, unexpected things to happen. Sometimes the complete opposite of the intended result will occur.

This makes me think that you need to give up some degree of control when scaling and leave room for the unexpected. The system you're trying to scale can be rigid in some places and flexible in others, to allow for an appropriate amount of weirdness.
