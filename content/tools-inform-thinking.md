title: "Tools inform your thinking"
---

The tools that you use convey, through their designs, a perspective on how they should be used and what they should be used for. For example, the design of a hammer clearly indicates that it should be used for driving and prying, and the form makes it obvious how to do so.

A similar paradigm is found in the sketching process where, if you set it up right, the constraints will force you into a certain valuable way of thinking. I've found that sketching is useful to me when I keep it at very low levels of detail and definition, so I limit myself to using larger markers or brush widths to make lines, and I rarely write out actual words. If I use a pen with a fine tip I tend to get too detailed too early. So, something as simple as choosing a certain writing implement can have a tremendous effect on your thinking and output.

With software, I opt for certain tools because of the mindsets and ways of working that they enforce upon me. An example of this is using Figma as my primary design tool. Figma has a way of manipulating UI components that didn't just align with how my brain works—it expanded my understand of component-driven design in digital products. When I was working in Sketch I used their "symbols" purely as a way to increase my design efficiency. When I use components in Figma I am still increasing my design efficiency, but I am also designing those components with an eye towards how they will function in code. Something about the way Figma handles components allows me to think bigger picture about the system. When I choose to make something into a component in Figma is not just about efficiency, it's about how the component needs to function in the system.
