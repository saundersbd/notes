title: "Vision is not a solution to a problem"
---

Vision requires more persistence than problem solving. If you think of a shared vision as a solution to a problem, the vision will run out of steam once the problem is solved. So, if you are trying to build a shared vision, it must be something that you work at every single day and not just in the light of problems.

It seems that you also can't apply shared vision as a solution to long-term goals, because goals are achievable and therefore have an expiration date. This seems to indicate that a shared vision needs to point to something more permanent, like a "true north." Something you are always striving to be and might never fully achieve.
