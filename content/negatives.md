title: "Defining requirements by looking at the negatives"
---

When you define design requirements, try to make a list of things the design should NOT do. Make a list of the things that are most worrisome or likely to go wrong. That's the best you can do. Misfits are more tangible than good fit.

In assessing the fit of a solution, we are not checking off a list of criteria. We are trying to eliminate the potential misfits.

In the example of trying to level a metal block, you assess the fit ([[Logic means nothing in a design without fit]]) by looking for the raised spots—the places where the fit is not good. Similarly, when assessing any design it is easier to point out the misfits than the things that are working.

> With this in mind, I should like to recommend that we should always expect to see the process of achieving good fit between two entities as a negative process of neutralizing the incongruities, or irritants, or forces, which cause misfit.
