title: "Intentionally generate alternate perspectives"
---

Deliberate generation of alternate perspectives is a lateral thinking technique by which you look at a situation and try to see it from different possible points of view. When you look at a situation, imagine how each actor or object would describe the situation differently. This generation of alternate perspectives might help you reframe a problem that you're trying to solve.

Example: Maybe you could tell a fairy tale from the villain's point of view?
