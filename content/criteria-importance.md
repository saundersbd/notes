title: "Some criteria are more important than others"
---

When defining a list of criteria to measure the success of a design effort, you can't just list out the criteria and call it a day. The criteria need to be assigned weights because [[Specific criteria definition affects design outcomes]]. You need to have an honest discussion about which success criteria you are going to prioritize in the design process.

Example:

- If "make it easy to give feedback" is more important than "quick response speed" you would make a different set of design decisions.
