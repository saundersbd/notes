title: "Arrive at your own answers"
---

Don't be so quick to push other people for answers. It is better to let the answers form naturally in your mind over time. Answers from others hold no weight in your brain because you haven't taken the time to process and really understand them.

When you do get answers from other people, try not to take them at face value. It is good to question the assumptions that are informing the answer and try to understand it for yourself. [[Question the assumptions that inform pre-packaged ideas]]
