title: "Are you really curious or just asking questions?"
---

There is a difference between asking questions just to ask them and asking them because you're genuinely curious. When you ask a question of someone, make sure that you're really interested in _understanding_ the answer. Avoid asking questions whose answers serve any means other than to enhance your own understanding.

I suppose small talk quesitons have their place as part of a ritual way of interacting with someone, but people can tell the difference between mechanical questions and questions asked because you're genuinely interested in the answer.

A good way to do this in practice is by asking follow-up questions that go beyond the surface questions.
