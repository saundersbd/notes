title: "Cultivate a noticing habit"
---

In _Team of Rivals_, I read that Salmon P. Chase wrote to his daughter in a letter to her at boarding school that she should develop a "noticing habit." This advice struck me as evergreen. Here's the full quote:

> “It will be a great advantage to you to cultivate a noticing habit. Accustom yourself to talk of what you see and to write details, and in a conversational, & even narrative style. There is the greatest possible difference in charm between the same narrative told by one person and by another ... No doubt a large part of this difference is to be ascribed to constitutional differences of temperament, but any intelligent person can greatly increase facility of apprehension & expression by careful self culture.”

The advice makes me wonder: How often do we really pay attention to what is going on around us? When we observe, do we just let what we see flit before us and the fade away into the depths of our consciousness? How often do we take the time to pause, and think about the details?

Some ideas for cultivating a noticing habit:

- Keep a notebook nearby to capture your fleeting impressions
- Reflect on your notes daily to solidify them in your memory
- Re-write your notes to make sure you understand them
- For every thing you see, push yourself to think about what is unique about that thing, or about its detailed aspects.
	- How does that thing compare to other things of its type? What are the similarities? What are the differences? What makes it special?
- Short-circuit your habit of categorizing things
	- When you see a tree, you don't have to dismiss it by immediately filing it away as a tree. Think about it on its own merit.
