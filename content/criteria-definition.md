title: "Specific criteria definition affects design outcomes"
---

When you take a vague criterion for measuring a design's success, such as consistency, it is important to define __how__ that design should be consistent and __what__ it should be consistent with. [[Consistency needs further definition]]

This is important because the definition of consistency you target will greatly affect the outcome of the design process.

For example, you can see that a design that optimizes for consistency with design system components will look and behave differently than a design that optimizes for consistency with other experiences in the outside world. Because the two definitions of consistency are at odds with one another, and you can't solve fully for both at the same time, you must prioritize one over the other.
