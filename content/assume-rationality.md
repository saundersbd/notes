title: "Assume people are acting rationally"
---

In the heat of the moment people seem to act rationally. What's tricky is figuring out what information, predispositions, time horizon, and biases came into play at the moment of the decision.

If you begin your assessment of a situation with the premise that everyone is acting rationally, it puts you in a mindset of curiosity and empathy. This mindset encourages you to focus on the individual and try to understand the forces in their life that influence their behavior.

The alternative is labeling someone's behavior as irrational. The problem with there is that by labeling someone's behavior as irrational you are orienting around your own biased perception of the situation. The act of processing and reacting to a situation starts with judging and labeling, rather than curiousity and a genuine interest in understanding the something about a who a person is.

This guidance of assuming that behavior is rational has been valuable both in my profession as a designer and in my relationships outside of work.

As a designer:

- Remind yourself that your users are not foolish and irrationalâ€”they are making rational decisions according to their unique context. From there you should try and understand that context.
- In peer critique, orient your feedback around understanding the "why" behind another designer's decision. Don't dismiss any solution to a problem outright.

In the world:

- Approach conflicts with curiousity and a desire to learn as opposed to a mindset of dismissive judgment
- Learn to catch yourself at the moment of judgment and choose a better alternative
