title: "Consistency needs further definition"
---

It's not enough to define "Consistency" as the sole metric for measuring the effectiveness of a proposed design solution. Consistency is a vague metric that can be framed in too many ways for it to be useful without further definition. We need only ask ourselves, "consistent with what?" in order to find that the answer could be any of the following:

- Components on the Citrus site
- What actually exists in production today
- The web platform
- The mobile platform
- The outside world
- Our future vision for the suite
    
The specific definition of consistency that you choose will greatly affect the outcome of the design process. [[Specific criteria definition affects design outcomes]]
