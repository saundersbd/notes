title: "Everyone thinks their personal system is the solution"

When things aren't working so well people tend to blame many factors. Everyone has their own unique view of what the problem is, and they all believe they know how it can be corrected. John Gall says that everyone believes their system would be the best system, if only it were universally adopted.

Maybe _any_ system would work if it were universally adopted. Adoption and behavior seem to be the trickiest aspects of system design. It's clear to me that no system springs forth into existence without baggage, and once it does appear it never goes away completely. There are no blank slates with systems design. And there's no such thing as universal adoption so we have to live with the reality that we need to understand systems broadly if we want to make any existing system function better. [[A temporary patch will likely become permanent]]
